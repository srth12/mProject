Unfortunatly, that's all there is to the film. The script is almost as big a joke as the charactors, and everything else follows the same path. If you're looking for a tease then see this flick, otherwise stay as far away as possible.","tomatoUserMeter":"72","tomatoUserRating":"3.2","tomatoUserReviews":"697,111","DVD":"29 Dec 2000","BoxOffice":"$59.8M","Production":"Buena Vista Pictures","Website":"http://studio.go.com/movies/coyoteugly/index.html","Response":"True"}
