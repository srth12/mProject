The key word is \"could.\" As it is, the script is predictable, the story becomes tedious, and it's simply not funny. Heather Graham shows she can play a central character, but she's not enough to make Committed successful.","tomatoUserMeter":"35","tomatoUserRating":"2.7","tomatoUserReviews":"3,828","DVD":"02 Oct 2001","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"http://www.miramax.com/mm_front/owa/mp.entryPoint?action=0&midStr=1335","Response":"True"}
